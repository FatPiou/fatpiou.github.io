<p>7
<strong> How scoring works: </strong>the first "point" is 15. The scoring goes: love (0), 15, 30, 40, then game. <br>
If the score is 40-40, then it's called a deuce. You have to win two times in a row, <br>
so if you win the point, and you're serving, it's called "advantage server". If you're receiving, <br>
then, clearly it's "advantage receiver". The players can also opt to do no-advantage, which means the first one to win the next point wins.
The first player to win 6 games wins the set. However, you need to win by 2. <br>
So for example, if the score is 6-4, then the person with 6 wins. <br>
<strong>Tiebreakers:</strong><br>
If the score is 6-5, then a tiebreaker starts. <br>
you start from zero, and using normal numbering, go up until one hits 7 points. <br>
If it's 6-5, but the opponent wins a point, becoming 6-6, then keep going until someone wins by 2.<br>
<em>Serves in Tiebreakers:</em> The player who would normally be serving after 6–6 is the one to serve first in the tiebreak, and the tiebreak is considered a service game for this player. <br>
The server begins his or her service from the deuce court and serves one point. <br>
After the first point, the serve changes to the first server's opponent. <br>
Each player then serves two consecutive points for the remainder of the tiebreak. <br>
The first of each two-point sequence starts from the server's advantage court and the second starts from the deuce court. <br>
In this way, the sum of the scores is even when the server serves from the deuce court. <br>
After every six points, the players switch ends of the court; <br>
note that the side-changes during the tiebreak will occur in the middle of a server's two-point sequence. <br>
At the end of the tiebreak, the players switch ends of the court again, since the set score is always odd (13 games).<br>
The tiebreak section is longer than the scoring section ;-;

 The base line, at the very end of each side, is wehre the players start from. Those long rectangular"boxes" <br>
on each side are called the alleys. The outer line is the doubles sideline, while the inner one is the singles sideline.<br>
The vertical line nearest to the center is called the service line. The horizontal line in the <em>middle</em> is called the center service line.<br>
The shorter boxes in the middle are called the service boxes. From the players POV, the deuce side is their right side.<br>
You start on the deuce side, and serve on to the <em>opposite</em> service box. <br>
You play one game, then switch sides. then play two games, and <em>switch again</em>.
